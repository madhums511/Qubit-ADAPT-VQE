# Qubit-ADAPT-VQE
An implementation of the Qubit-ADAPT VQE and VQD for the Kolos-Wolniewicz basis representation of a hydrogen-antihydrogen dimer (Summer 2023- Humboldt University, Berlin) 

adapt: Fully "qubitised" implementation of the algorithm that can be run on IBM simulators (runs very slowly) \
adapt_hack : Reduced runtime \
hhsp02: Uses the Kolos-Wolniewicz basis set to model the ground state wavefunction of the hydrogen-antihydrogen dimer (Alejandro Saenz, 1998)
